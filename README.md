========================================

PROJECT
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the writer's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 


PROJECT SETUP  

An exciting area in data science is wearable computing.
Companies are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
